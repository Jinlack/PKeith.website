        <p>
            Liberia, located on the west coast of Africa, is the continent's oldest republic. 
            Its history is unique, intertwined with the legacy of the transatlantic slave trade 
            and the efforts of freed African Americans seeking a return to their ancestral homeland.
        </p>
        <p><h2 align="left">Early History</h2>
            Before the arrival of Europeans, the region now known as Liberia was inhabited by various indigenous ethnic groups, 
            including the Bassa, Vai, Kru, and Kpelle. These groups had rich cultures and established societies with their own 
            political systems and trade networks.
