    <h1>Brief History:</h1>

        <h2>Colonization and Settlement</h2>
        In the early 19th century, the American Colonization Society (ACS) was founded with the 
        goal of resettling freed African Americans in Africa. In 1822, the ACS established a settlement 
        at Cape Mesurado, naming it Monrovia after James Monroe, the U.S. President who supported the 
        colonization efforts. Over the following decades, thousands of freed slaves and free-born 
        African Americans emigrated to Liberia, leading to the establishment of a series of colonies.

        <h2>Independence</h2>
        On July 26, 1847, Liberia declared its independence, becoming the first African republic to do so. 
        The new nation modeled its constitution and government after the United States. Joseph Jenkins Roberts, 
        a free-born African American from Virginia, became Liberia's first president.

        <h2>20th Century</h2>
        Throughout the 20th century, Liberia faced various challenges, including economic 
        difficulties and political struggles. The True Whig Party dominated Liberian politics from 
        1878 to 1980, making the country essentially a one-party state. The Americo-Liberian elite, 
        descendants of the original settlers, held significant power, often marginalizing the indigenous
         population.

<h2>Civil Wars</h2>
In 1980, a military coup led by Samuel Doe ended over a century of Americo-Liberian rule. Doe's regime, 
however, was marked by human rights abuses and corruption. In 1989, Charles Taylor's rebel group, 
the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), launched an insurgency against Doe, 
plunging the country into a brutal civil war that lasted until 1996.

A second civil war erupted in 1999, leading to widespread devastation and displacement. 
The conflict ended in 2003 with the Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement, 
facilitated by international intervention, particularly from the Economic Community of 
West African States (ECOWAS) and the United Nations.

<h2>Recovery</h2>
Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was elected president in 2005, becoming the first female head of state in Africa. 
Her administration focused on rebuilding the nation, addressing corruption, 
and fostering economic development. Despite significant progress, Liberia continued to face challenges 
such as poverty, infrastructure deficits, and the aftermath of the Ebola outbreak in 2014-2016.

<h2>Recent Developments</h2>
In 2017, George Weah, a former international football star, won the presidential election, 
signaling a continued commitment to democratic processes. His administration has been working on 
economic reforms and infrastructure development, though the nation still grapples with significant 
socio-economic issues.

Liberia's history is marked by resilience and the ongoing effort to build a peaceful, stable, 
and prosperous nation.
